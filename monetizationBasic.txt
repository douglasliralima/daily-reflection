This was a answer of a user related of how he monetize his app, my idea is not to focus on the monetization

I'm doing it much more for the sake of doing, not exactly to profit, buut, I need to pay the servers and do the
maintanance, so some money would is necessary...

We offer 3 tiers our apps, monthly subscription, yearly subscription and lifetime licence.

Yearly cost about 3-4x monthly,
Lifetime costs about 8-9x monthly.

We get around 40% income from subscriptions and 60% from lifetime licenses.

You can easily experiment with the lifetime licence price, since it doesn't break any auto renew subscriptions for users.
